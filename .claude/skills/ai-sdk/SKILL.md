description: 'Answer questions about the AI SDK and help build AI-powered features. Use when developers: (1) Ask about AI SDK functions like generateText, streamText, ToolLoopAgent, embed, or tools, (2) Want to build AI agents, chatbots, RAG systems, or text generation features, (3) Have questions about AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.), streaming, tool calling, structured output, or embeddings, (4) Use React hooks like useChat or useCompletion. Triggers on: "AI SDK", "Vercel AI SDK", "generateText", "streamText", "add AI to my app", "build an agent", "tool calling", "structured output", "useChat".'

## Prerequisites

First inspect the project's dependencies and applicable instructions. Use `node_modules/ai/docs/` when present; otherwise consult current official documentation. Do not install a package just to read documentation or answer a question. Install dependencies only when needed for authorized implementation, using the repository's package manager and lockfile rules.

Do not install other packages at this stage. Provider packages (e.g., `@ai-sdk/openai`) and client packages (e.g., `@ai-sdk/react`) should be installed later when needed based on user requirements.

## Critical: Do Not Trust Internal Knowledge

Everything you know about the AI SDK is outdated or wrong. Your training data contains obsolete APIs, deprecated patterns, and incorrect usage.

**When working with the AI SDK:**

1. Inspect the installed version and integration, if any (see Prerequisites)
2. Search `node_modules/ai/docs/` and `node_modules/ai/src/` for current APIs
3. If not found locally, search ai-sdk.dev documentation (instructions below)
4. Never rely on memory - always verify against source code or docs
5. **`useChat` has changed significantly** - check [Common Errors](references/common-errors.md) before writing client code
6. Preserve the user's selected model/provider and the project's existing integration. Use AI Gateway when requested or already established; see [AI Gateway Reference](references/ai-gateway.md). Do not introduce a gateway or replace a native runtime solely because this skill was loaded.
7. Verify a new model ID against current official docs and the selected provider's catalog. Do not choose a model by sorting version numbers, override an explicit model choice, or assume that availability through one provider proves availability through another.
8. Run the repository's applicable checks after code changes. Do not add implementation-mirroring tests for reversible, low-impact changes. Repeat or broaden passing checks only for new changes, failures, or unresolved concerns.
9. **Be minimal** - Only specify options that differ from defaults. When unsure of defaults, check docs or source rather than guessing or over-specifying.

If you cannot find documentation to support your answer, state that explicitly.

## Finding Documentation

### ai@6.0.34+

Search bundled docs and source in `node_modules/ai/`:

- **Docs**: `grep "query" node_modules/ai/docs/`
- **Source**: `grep "query" node_modules/ai/src/`

Provider packages include docs at `node_modules/@ai-sdk/<provider>/docs/`.

### Earlier versions

1. Search: `https://ai-sdk.dev/api/search-docs?q=your_query`
2. Fetch `.md` URLs from results (e.g., `https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/agents/building-agents.md`)

## When Typecheck Fails

**Before searching source code**, grep [Common Errors](references/common-errors.md) for the failing property or function name. Many type errors are caused by deprecated APIs documented there.

If not found in common-errors.md:

1. Search `node_modules/ai/src/` and `node_modules/ai/docs/`
2. Search ai-sdk.dev (for earlier versions or if not found locally)

## Building and Consuming Agents

### Creating Agents

For a new AI SDK agent, consider the supported `ToolLoopAgent` pattern after checking current docs. Preserve an existing harness and the user's requested architecture; loading this skill does not authorize a runtime migration.

**File conventions**: See [type-safe-agents.md](references/type-safe-agents.md) for where to save agents and tools.

**Type Safety**: When consuming agents with `useChat`, always use `InferAgentUIMessage<typeof agent>` for type-safe tool results. See [reference](references/type-safe-agents.md).

### Consuming Agents (Framework-Specific)

Before implementing agent consumption:

1. Check `package.json` to detect the project's framework/stack
2. Search documentation for the framework's quickstart guide
3. Follow the framework-specific patterns for streaming, API routes, and client integration
